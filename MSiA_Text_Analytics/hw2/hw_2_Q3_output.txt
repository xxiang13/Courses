Berk Bozoklar Bio : 
I grow up in Izmir , Turkey . Izmir be a nice city by the west coast of Izmir . contrary to Chicago , the weather be usually hot . people enjoy the weather by run , biking and water sport . so it take I some time to adapt to windy city . 
fascinate by the thought of design and build thing , I come to United States after graduate high school . I get accept to George Washington University with a engineering scholarship . I decide to become a biomedical engineer because of my interest in biology , which come from both my parent be doctor . I graduate as a biomedical engineer with a minor in apply mathematics . during this time , I get a chance to learn analytical thinking and to develop my programming skill set . as a undergrad , my internship as a datum analyst in BP 's sale department , and my work as a signal analysis/reporting in a senior design project at George Washington University play a essential role in develop a interest in machine learning and predictive analytic . 
I recognize that msium at Northwestern University give I a opportunity to enhance my analytical , quantitative , and programming skill in the analytic field . I believe that analytic be a grow , dynamic field that have potential to branch out its focus to different field such as risk management , market analytic and operation research within company and research field . come from engineering major , I be enthusiastic about try to apply analytic to industry in a positive way that can provide . 
as a part of msium at Northwestern University , I be thrill and look forward to work and learn with people who share similar interest and passion about analytic and datum science . I hope to use the analytical skill I gain in the msium program to help company and organization utilize they datum and transform they into valuable and meaningful datum drive solution to challenging problem that can make a difference in the world . 
I become interested text analytic after see the use of text analytic in social media . I be so amaze by the potential of impact making analysis of social media datum . Social media create a platform for people to express themselves about event in life and you can record other people s reaction to that . I believe this create a great potential for analysis that can lead to datum drive solution by understand the datum present at social media which be text datum . 
I grow up in the small town of West Brookfield , Massachusetts , but generally when people ask `` where be you from ? '' , I say Worcester . 
I move there when I be 18 and still consider the seven year I spend work as a cabinet maker , a musician , and a board member of 
a small non-profit my most formative year . in 2008 , the housing market begin to take a dive and so do the market for custom cabinetry . 
it be at this time that I decide I take a chance on get a college education . 
I work three part-time job -lrb- contractor , lab assistant , rock climb instructor -rrb- when I first attend community 
college and quickly realize that while I be interested in work with computer , 
I be more interested in human-computer interaction . eventually , I begin work with Jeremy Birnholtz and Jeff Hancock on a project 
that seek to understand the role of deception in text messaging and a phenomenon they call `` Butler lie '' . this project get I very 
interested in text analysis and how the information derive from text datum be connect with real human social behavior . 
I continue this work in my undergraduate honor thesis where I attempt to create a predictive model of deception in 
text messaging to further understand its role and prevalence . while the ultimate conclusion be simply that the main 
lie that can accurately be detect be those that may seem obvious , such as `` I be on my way '' , it help support the 
argument that when people be able to hide they context -lrb- where they really be , what they be really do -rrb- , they 
will often employ deception as a strategy in social life management . 
upon graduation , I receive the Data Science for Social Good fellowship where I work on a project which use co-occurrence 
matrix of keyword in a corpus of job posting and resume to understand the real supply and demand of skill in the job 
market . this fellowship expose I to many different kind of datum analysis and they pro and con . when I begin at Northwestern University 
as a student in Technology and Social Behavior , I want to better understand how these datum analysis can help or hurt research and development 
in sociotechnical system which be why much of my current research employ a mixed method approach with both quantitative datum analysis and 
qualitative interview with the participant who volunteer the datum . 
in the future , I hope to begin bridge the gap between the design of algorithm use for context sense and personal 
informatics and the user interaction that typically generate the datum use in these algorithm . my hypothesis be that 
a well design user interaction can further the goal of the participant while simultaneously make the learning 
problem more tractable for machine learning algorithm in context-sensing . I believe that if both application 
design and research begin see these as inseparable problem , then we begin develop context-sensing application 
that truly help individual with the kind of self-reflection and self-monitoring need for treat mental 
illness such as those use in cognitive behavioral therapy .

I be originally from a area call the Quad Cities , which be a very small 
metropolitan area on the Mississippi River that include city in both Illinois 
and Iowa . it be , I think , the only place that the Mississippi River run 
east-west . after graduate with a computer science degree from Bradley 
University in Peoria , Illinois , I move to Chicago to work as a software 
developer . I become interested in pursue a career that focus more on the 
human element of computing , so I leave that job to pursue a master 's degree in 
Information Architecture from Illinois Tech . it be during that time that I 
become interested in continue to do research into socio-technical system , 
which be how I end up in the technology and Social Behavior phd program at 
Northwestern . give that I primarily study communication behavior on social 
media platform , text analytic be a important methodology to I . while a lot of 
research in my field focus on qualitative method , I think natural language 
processing and text mining provide a alternative way to make sense of the 
massive amount of datum generate by social media site . I think there be a lot 
of interesting question in this area that I could continue to pursue in a 
academic career , but I also know a lot of people in my field end up in user

I be currently do my phd in Industrial Engineering and management Sciences at Northwestern University . I obtain my bachelor and master degree in Industrial Engineering in South Korea , which mean that my native language be korean . during undergrad I be very interested in datum analysis and statistics . this lead I to continue to pursue master degree in field of apply statistics . my research during master degree be about quality improvement in semiconductor manufacturing process . I develop a statistic that can decide if there be serious defect in the production process . after obtain master degree I start work at a car part manufacture company , a part of Hyundai motor group , in South Korea . my main job at work be to take care of the quality of the car part that be export to european country . while I be work there , I realize that my knowledge be not sufficient and I would like to be specialize in a field . I decide to pursue phd . during my first year in graduate study at Northwestern University , I become more interested in optimization methodology . to combine my interest in optimization and datum analysis I start do research that I solve optimization problem in the field of machine learning . I be currently solve classification problem that incorporate Restricted Boltzmann machine that be normally use to initialize weight in network model . to verify my method , I consider many problem such as image and document classification . when I deal with text datum , I find that it be not easy to create feature vector from unstructured text . since I have limit knowledge about language it be hard for I to understand concept and vocabulary use in linguistics . in addition , I realize that text analytic be really important since the performance of the model be highly dependent on the extract feature . that be , even if I have a nice mathematical model accurate classification can not be obtain without well-defined feature . in this sense , I really need to know how to deal with text datum . my goal regard text analytic be to develop new mathematical model that work well in text as well as image datum . furthermore , I would like to develop new feature extractor that can be use for my math model . 
I be originally from Cincinnati , Ohio . I enrol in MSIA because of some experience I have while work at Proctor & Gamble as a product researcher . I notice that we collect lot of datum , but there be not many people who could actually process and make sense of it . prior to enrol at Northwestern , I complete a phd in experimental psychology . my research focus on the connection between perception , memory , and decision-making . my interest in text analytic begin while I be conduct research , as I often have to parse key word from open-ended response question . the process of extract meaning from text turn out to be a lot more challenging -lrb- and interesting -rrb- than I have believe at the outset . upon graduation , I 'll be work at Nike WHQ in Beaverton , or as a datum scientist . I work at Nike over the summer and it be a really fun place to be . I be look forward to return in January .

I participate in a Hackathon . the project we do be about sentiment analysis and analyze relationship between article quality and positive review by audience . it be a simple text analysis project . therefore , I want to dive deeper in text analytic and get to know more technique . my 3 year plan be to become a excellent datum scientist . let we just have fun ! 
MSiA text analytic - hw0 - Luis Steven Lin 
I be from Chicago , il and complete my undergraduate degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . during my study , I have the opportunity to gain consult experience through various industrial and academic project . in addition , I also have the opportunity to do internship with fortune 500 company and family-owned business in diverse industry range from paper , metal and telecommunication to airline , entertainment and transportation . however , a common theme during my academic and professional career be turn datum into actionable insight . although I find myself with a wealth of datum at my fingertip , I feel limit by the sheer size and unstructured nature of the datum . I feel at the time that I do not have a solid understanding of the mathematics and it skill require to analyze complex data-related problem . 
my interest in the emerge field of Data Science and Analytics bring to the master of science in analytic at Northwestern University . the opportunity to learn how to successfully leverage unstructured and user-generated datum intrigue I . I believe there have never be a more exciting time in the world of datum . we now have the capability and tool to use datum like never before . I have always be curious about the underlie story behind the datum . I find it fascinating how one can combine rigorous analysis and creativity to find relationship among variable , detect trend and spot pattern to uncover insight that be hide within the datum . 
one of the topic I be very interested be text analytic . with the growth of the internet , mobile device and increase interaction of people with technology that generate datum , analyze text datum have become a new valuable and rich source of datum . for example , I have do project be analyze customer review -lrb- e.g. yelp -rrb- provide additional insight that other source of datum do not . I have also work on a project to automate question and answering system that be very interesting . I be very interesting in learn how to efficiently process text datum and find creative use . 
with the explosion of datum generate by people across the globe and the development of the `` internet of thing '' , I hope to use the knowledge and skill learn in the msium program to harness the datum , create data-driven product and improve people 's life .

hw 0 bio 
I be originally from Denver Colorado , a city which -lrb- I must submit as a clearly unbiased observer -rrb- be one of the finest in this great republic . I major in Cognitive Psychology at Stanford University , with a focus in the cognitive science where I first have the opportunity to work with some of the topic we ll be deal with in this class . in particular I be fascinate by the opportunity to use machine language to understand and analyze the symbolic system that be central to human cognition . I study both the cognitive and discourse-focused aspect of human language , as well as the way computational linguistics approach some of these topic . after college I take a brief interlude work in clinical research for the Department of Veterans Affairs , back in Denver , though my interest in cognition and language didn t flag much . ultimately after have pursue research for two year I recognize that answer my own research question would be the most rewarding use of my time I decide to pursue a phd in psychology . give that some of the work of my college adviser , Lera Boroditsky , be influence by she time work at Northwestern , I apply to work with Dedre Gentner study the cognitive mechanism behind language . 
my interest in text analytic stem from a desire to increase the range and capability of my research . there be many technique be use in psycholinguistic study , especially computational one , which I haven t have the opportunity to work with , and one that my adviser be also relatively unfamiliar with . a healthy understanding of text analytic and the computational theory that make it possible can only serve to bolster my research ability . on a personal note i also thoroughly enjoy the logical challenge design program present . I have always be someone who love puzzle and I consider many of the topic in machine learning simply complicated puzzle that demand answer . while ultimately I hope to make use of these technique in my own research , I relish the opportunity to simply tackle a difficult topic . 
I be currently in my third year at Northwestern , where I be get a phd in Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences . I grow up primarily in Kansas , in a suburb outside of Kansas City . accordingly I be a big Kansas City Royals baseball fan , as well as a devout follower of the Kansas Jayhawks basketball team . I leave Kansas for college , and since then have live in Boston , Moscow , Madison , and -lrb- for the last 5 year -rrb- Chicago . between finish my undergraduate degree and start my current program , I spend six year work in addition to finish a master 's degree . I have job with the russian academy of Sciences , the 2008 Obama campaign , and as a management consultant . my current research have nothing to do with text analytic . I be look at the optimal pricing of electricity . currently , most electricity retailer charge a flat rate per kilowatt hour to they residential customer . slightly more complicated rate be charge to larger commercial and industrial customer . however , inefficiency arise because the price charge to consumer do not accurately reflect the cost to purchase the electricity from generator . smarter pricing , combine with advanced metering infrastructure and smarter device , would allow end-use consumer to respond to fluctuation in the cost . this have the potential to improve grid stability and , even more importantly , bring down peak demand , allow we to avoid overbuilding capacity . however , I be interested in learn about the tool of text analytic for potential future project . separately , I be curious about potential application of my field -lrb- optimization -rrb- in the field of linguistics . I be interested in language ; this have manifest in my study of Latin , Russian , Portuguese , and spanish to vary degree of fluency . I also like read about historical linguistics and etymology . for instance , I be recently look into mathematical model of language extinction . I have not look seriously at computational linguistics , but be interested in read more . 
bear and raise in mn , but a California transplant since ' 99 . I graduate from uc Berkeley -lrb- Go Bears ! -rrb- in 2001 with a degree in chemical engineering with a emphasis in biotech . I spend a few year as a engineering consultant in the biotech industry , and then -- after gradually turn from hobby to passion - in 2005 I make the jump to become a full-time professional Poker Player . I play poker mostly online , and in 2011 the government -lrb- effectively -rrb- shut down online poker in the US . know that I do not want to go back into engineering for a career , I do some soul search , and with the help of a friend discover datum science . I take some course on Coursera to see if this field would be something that I would enjoy and would be intellectually stimulate , and after really like the coursework , start to apply to grad school program . I get accept into the MSiA 2014-2015 cohort at Northwestern and the rest be history . 
I tend to do a lot of research when it come to purchase , so naturally I have a interest in consumer analytic . my medium term goal be to start up my own company in consumer analytic . I have a grow list of idea and hope to one day see -lrb- at least -rrb- one of they come to fruition . a couple of my idea would require text analytic -lrb- one very much so -rrb- , and that be what have lead I to text analytic as a elective . I also could have use text analytic in my internship , and would like to have it as another skill in my arsenal as a datum scientist . 
I work to live -lrb- not live to work -rrb- , so I aim to be able to have a good work-life balance where I can still travel the world and go on new adventure . 
I be from a small coastal town in south India . I graduate from IIT Madras in 2012 where I major in Biotechnology . I start my career with Cognizant Technology Solutions in they analytic group where I work with top pharmaceutical company in the world in project relate to optimize salesforce effort . after spend a year at Cognizant , I work at a analytic consult start-up company where I take on bigger responsibility and work on multiple challenging project in various domain . I believe that the role of analytic will continue to grow and will soon become a integral part of every product and service . I feel the need to continue on the path of learning . I want to learn various statistical technique and cut edge technology in depth . I like to work on stimulating and exciting problem . I think text analytic be very interesting and open up new avenue to solve real life problem that weren t easy to tackle before .

I grow up in the Hudson Valley in New York and graduate from Wesleyan University with a B.A. in music . I then spend my professional life in New York City after graduate . much of this early era of my life do not have a lot to do with my interest in analytic , but a lot of it make for very interesting dinner party conversation . 
I start the msium program after work at the Innocence Project , a non-profit organization dedicate to use dna litigation to overturn wrongful conviction and implement policy reform to prevent further injustice . while serve as the Legal Operations Coordinator for the legal department there , I be task with implement change to the department 's case management system due to the organization 's grow need for datum collection and analysis . this begin my interest in the intersection of datum analysis and the justice system . while I continue to work at the Innocence Project , I complete my second bachelor 's degree in statistics at Hunter College . this background bring I to the msium program , where I want to learn more about the practical aspect and skill involve in apply datum analysis . 
my interest in text analytic originate in my work in the legal field , where I spend much of my time with text document and conduct project primarily relate to digest large amount of text or finding crucial and specific information from a large volume of text . I begin to suspect that there could be more efficient way of do some of these project , without know much of what be really technologically possible . I be still not entirely sure of the extent of what be possible and reliable in this application , but my capstone project and this class will help to start answer those question . 
I be currently search for a datum science position in the Bay Area for life-after-MSIA . I hope to eventually return to public service work , but want to use my time immediately after graduation to gain experience at a company where datum science be a essential part of its function and learn from those more experienced in this field .

where you be from : I be originally from Pakistan , bear in Islamabad the capital city of the country . 
what bring you to you current graduate program -lrb- e.g. , msium -rrb- -- I strongly believe without the right analytic capability , the sheer volume of datum and the complex system that house it , will simply increase cost and inefficiency with little insight . while with my practical experience couple with the modern academic tool of analytic that I hope to gain during this master 's Degree , I can leverage the power of analytic to solve business and research problem aim to quickly validate assumption , provide the right statistical analysis and deliver flexible solution for various business problem . 
what do you do before this program : I graduate from the National University of Sciences and Technology , Pakistan with a bachelor 's degree in Information Technology in 2012 . as a student , I continuously probe different area that appeal to I as potential area of research . hence , in addition to the standard course offer in the program , I opt for research at the IBM 's Linux Competency Center in the domain of business intelligence and advance analytic . the project I work involve extensive use of data-mining technique for stock price prediction and its relation with different economic variable . later when it come to apply my interest professionally , I be fortunate enough to land himself with a offer from IBM . a industrial project on churn prediction and behavioral segmentation for a well-known Telco be about to commence , when I be ask to join the IBM 's Advanced Analytics & Big Data competency . the core focus during this project remain on a in-depth analysis of the datum for better pre-processing and use optimize predictive modeling technique to improve overall model accuracy . later I work on some of the key assignment at IBM U.S.A which involve extensive unstructured datum for Operational Analytics , some of the notable client be list in global 50 financial service corporation . all this professional work and past research have upsurge my passion for descriptive , predictive and prescriptive analytic use multiple statistical analysis , datum mining and machine learning technique . 
when do you become interested in text analytic : at IBM a significant amount of my time be spend with unstructured datum for analysis and modeling . the datum could be in the form of customer comment or help desk ticket where I be require to identify chronic issue for high frequency ticket and problem/resolver group from unstructured field use text mining technique like text cleanse , document classification and concept mining . this develop my interest to look deeper into different text analytical technique which could better explain the context of this datum . 
what be you plan for the future : my target be to evolve system which provide timely datum analysis by offer a clear view of the present and a deeper insight into the future which can help company in better strategy and planning . 
whatever else you want to include : Interested in cognitive analytic and explore advanced topics/techniques in text analytic

accord to venerable family tradition , I be raise by a solitary shewolf in the Adirondack mountain of northern New York until my chance discovery by a rogue botanist at age 4 . it take several year of supervised therapy , behavioral correction , and operant conditioning until the local school district relunctantly deem I fit for normal human interaction . this much , at least , my parent contend to be true . 
on a more serious note , I become interested in language -- and more generally , its scientific study -- as a sophomore at university . due to some rather odd pre-collegiate educational circumstance that I will not elaborate on here , I do not encounter a `` foreign language '' until I take my first foreign language course during my second year as a college student . at that point , I become enthral with the language of the world , they structure , and they literary dimension . after several additional academic turn -lrb- the detail of which I do not have time to expound upon here -rrb- , I settle at Northwestern University in pursuit of a phd in linguistics . 
I become interested in text analytic thanks to my education here at NU as method of analyze text have figure prominently into both course project and departmental milestone . though most of my work to date have focus solely on static corpus , I do hope to expand to look at more dynamic corpus -lrb- or better : corpus of language that be still live ! -rrb- . 
in the future , I hope to be outstanding in the field of excellence . in addition to pursue my research interest in supervised and unsupervised language acquisition , I hope to apply insight from these domain to language learning curriculum and technology in some meaningful way . 
my name be Igor . I move to the Chicago area from Russia when I be four , and have live here since . I know that I be interested in 
analytic come out of my undergraduate program in Economics at Northwestern , and I feel that the msium program would help I find a job 
as a datum scientist . before the program I work in consult for two year . I become interset in text analytic through the short introduction 
to it we have have in other MSiA course . in the future I plan to build some predictive model .

Hi Professor Bicknell , thank you very much to be with we for text analytic this quarter . 
my name be Lily -lrb- Qian -rrb- Zhao and I be originally from Beijing , China . I come directly after get my bachelor degree in electrical Engineering . my interest grow into datum analytic when I be a research assistant at school use MATLAB to analyze datum from dynamic electricity power system . for internship experience , I intern at Accenture , China Electric Power Institute and Micron Technology before yet no full time experience so far . 
I get my first glimpse of text analytic when there be a new product come to the chinese facebook four or five year ago , renren.com , where people could generate the ` key word ' of they social network and the font size indicate the frequency . 
I think it be very cool yet that be it . until recently -lrb- well , a few month ago -rrb- I start a series of datum mine online course from uiuc -lrb- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/datamining -rrb- there be two text analytic related course : text Retrieval and search engine / text mining and analytic . I complete both and really like the topic . the first one be more about the concept and the second one be more about application . in the second course 's programming assignment , yelp provide a -lrb- huge -rrb- dataset -lrb- with review , business info etc. -rrb- for the student to practice and I find it be quite cool to extract very much and valuable information out of the raw text . -lrb- please refer to https://lilyqianz.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/coursera_datamining_wk1.pdf for a sample of my homework -rrb- 
as a fan of the bay area and a interest in analytic , I would love to start my career in datum analytic in the sf bay area . and maybe I would get back to school for further education after a year or two of work . 
for I be very interested in marry visualization and text analytic , could you please give any recommendation for that ? -lrb- book , paper or tool ? -rrb- thank you very much ! I be very excite for this class ! 
• where you be from 
my name be Xiaofeng Zhu , a second year graduate student in computer science . I come from a small but beautiful coastal city in china . I go to a university very close to my hometown , after that apply the computer science master program of Northwestern University in 2013 , and then be luckily switch to the Ph.D. program one year later . my current research focus on text mining and knowledge management . 
• what bring you to you current graduate program -lrb- e.g. , msium -rrb- ? 
the direct reason why I apply my current graduate program be that computer science be the only sophisticated subject I have be work on before I want to go abroad for further study , which mean I basically have no other choice at that moment . another stronger reason be that I be teach to find out prospective and challenging aspect of direct and/or teach computer to handle thing that be difficult for human being . 
• what do you do before this program ? 
nothing huge have happen to I till now . before be enrol into this program , I spend most of my time try to become a professional student in order to get into Northwestern University . I start to get to know some common method in datum mining when I be a undergraduate student , but do not narrow down my study field to text mining until I come to Northwestern University . 
• when do you become interested in text analytic ? 
I be once ask to do a question and answer web application for a course project use Watson API of which one core component be text analytic . understand the semantic meaning of text and be able to learn information automatically be so attract that I feel in love with text analytic at first sight . since then , I have be do text analytic related project for almost two year . 
• what be you plan for the future ? 
I will and would love to devote myself to the knowledge acquisition and semantic query research field no matter in industry or academia . 
• whatever else you want to include ! 
in general , I be a physically and mentally healthy person . be dedicated and enjoy fun be always my life and study goal .
